## What this is

Ansible Web is the official web client for the Ansible messenger. It
is built on top of the Telegram Web A codebase under GPL v3, with the
following high-level modifications:

- Networking layer (custom GramJS) rewritten to use the **MVSy 1.0**
  protocol and connect to Ansible backend servers (instead of MTProto
  2.0 / Telegram DCs).
- Branding, visual identity, and product naming replaced throughout.
- Telegram-specific features removed where not applicable to Ansible
  (e.g., Telegram Premium subscriptions, Telegram Stars, Fragment
  integration, sponsored messages).
- Additional features added that are unique to Ansible.

The complete list of changes from upstream is tracked in
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). The upstream changelog is preserved in
[`UPSTREAM_CHANGELOG.md`](UPSTREAM_CHANGELOG.md) for reference.

## Relationship to upstream

| | Telegram Web A | Ansible Web |
|---|---|---|
| License | GPL v3 | GPL v3 — same |
| Backend | Telegram DCs | Ansible servers (`mvsy.ansible.rest`) |
| Protocol | MTProto 2.0 (via GramJS) | MVSy 1.0 (via custom GramJS fork) |
| Trademarks | Telegram Web A | Ansible |
| Account compatibility | Telegram accounts | Ansible accounts (separate system) |
| Source repository | [Ajaxy/telegram-tt](https://github.com/Ajaxy/telegram-tt) | [ansible-web/ansible-web](https://github.com/ansible-web/ansible-web) |

We do **not** merge updates from upstream automatically. The fork is
independently maintained.

## Try it

Hosted instance: <https://web.ansible.rest/>

Source release archives: <https://github.com/ansible-web/ansible-web/releases>

For Telegram Web A (the upstream project) please visit
[telegram.org/web](https://web.telegram.org/a).

## Local setup

```sh
mv .env.example .env
npm i
npm run dev
```

The `.env` file should point to your Ansible backend instance. No
Telegram `api_id` is required — Ansible uses its own protocol.
